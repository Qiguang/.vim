this repo contain my vim config files that I want to sync among computers.

note:

	I use Vundle.vim to manage plugins, but vindle.vim cannot be added to this repo as it is a stand alone repo.
	so I have to install vundle.vim every time I clone this repo to a new computer.the install method is in the readme.md of vundle repo.
	I use molokai colorscheme because the color definations are clear. and I have modified some of the colors to fit my habit.

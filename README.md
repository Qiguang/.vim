this repo contain my vim config files that I want to sync among computers.

note:

	I use vim-plug to manage plugins.
	please install vim-plug every time you clone this repo to a new computer. The install approach please refer to corresponding repo.
	I use molokai colorscheme because the color definations are clear. and I have modified some of the colors to fit my habit.
